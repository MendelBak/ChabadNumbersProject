TODO:
- MultiPicker needs to match the number selected prior.
- Add responsiveness using media queries /breakpoints
- The data model for this project is really dumb. I defined my class structure inside the JSON file instead of creating a TS model/class. Dumb...
- add charts at the end tallying the responses so far
- add DB to collect responses (GCP?)
## How to start
