TODO:
- Save surveyResponseObj in localstorage so that responses don't get lost and that prior components will be populated.
- MultiPicker needs to match the number selected prior.
- Add responsiveness using media queries /breakpoints
- The data model for this project is really dumb. I defined my class structure inside the JSON file instead of creating a TS model/class. Dumb...
- I just added the context providor and dispatches. I now need to remove the old code in survey.tsx that uses local state to manage the survey data.
## How to start
```
npm run install
npm run dev
```
